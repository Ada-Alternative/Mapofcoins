    "Info": "Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called crypto-currency, which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list. Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than relying on central authorities. In 2009, the first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in a cryptography mailing list by a member under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto.Towards the end of 2010 Satoshi left the project, saying he had moved on to other things. However since 2010, the Bitcoin community has grown a lot. And there is no wonder: Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system."

Litecoin provides faster transaction confirmations and uses a memory-hard, scrypt-based mining proof-of-work algorithm to target the regular computers and GPUs most people already have. One of the aims of Litecoin was to provide a mining algorithm that could run at the same time, on the same hardware used to mine bitcoins. With the rise of specialized ASICs for Bitcoin, Litecoin continues to satisfy these goals. It is unlikely for ASIC mining to be developed for Litecoin until the currency is widely used."

However this coin was not seen in positive eyes by some members of the forum (namely Luke-Jr(references needed) and Greedi), so Greedi performed a 51% attack on the chain and stopped people mining coins and rejected blocks from other users. This attack meant that people lost interest and faith in BBQcoin. Then on February 08, 2013, 07:58:05 PM it was announced by user markm that BBQcoin was still ticking along and has been since it started and that now that the attackers have left the alt-currency forum BBQ coin seemed to gain a little support and miners hopped back on inthe hope of mining at not such ridiculous difficulties. The original developer Cubox seems to have almost abandoned the project and the original source code is not available, though look in the downloads section as figroll, a member of the BBQcoin development team, has forked the original BBQ repository and made it available.

By buying Devcoins, you help fund developers and give the world more open source software, books, music, art, and movies. Bounties are funded based on market capitalization. When the market capitalization of Devcoin reaches a certain point, a massive bounty will be offered for the development of an open source one seater spacecraft which can exit and enter the Earth's atmosphere."

This demurrage fee was proposed by Silvio Gesell to eliminate the privileged position held by money compared with capital goods, which is the underlying cause of the boom/bust business cycle and the entrenchment of the financial elite, and has been tested several times with positive results. Freicoin's parameters are carefully chosen to eliminate the basic interest component of investments, called the liquidity premium by economists. Usurious non-zero basic interest distorts the free market, incentivises poisonous greed, excess, and short-term thinking, and perpetuates a vicious cycle of boom/bust recessions."

NTC uses a new approach to secure hashing algorithms for the hash tree of a given block that should increase FPGA/ASIC resistance. After 27 coin years it employs a system of voting to manipulate the interest rate of the block chain (users act as the central bank and regulate the rate of inflation). Ledger system for regular coins that allows for a lightweight version of the blockchain instead of having to download the entire blockchain."

The time draws near, the return of The Great Old One is upon us. Join us in our ritual. During the first and second weeks of the ritual, sacrificial amounts are placed in special, once a day blocks. These blocks are a reward to the worshipper for sacrifice made. During the third and fourth weeks of the ritual the rewards build, small at first, then larger as the worship increases with fervor. During the last five days, the 'Tharanak shagg,' or 'promise of dreamland', the ritual reaches final pitch and the daily special blocks are highly increased. Finally Cthulhu will return after the 50665th offering has paid tribute to the Great Old One and he will bestow a bounty deserving of Him upon one lucky worshiper. The ritual can be repeated after six months time, following the great halving."

SHAvite-3's compression functions are secure against cryptanalysis, while the selected mode of iteration offers maximal security against black box attacks on the hash function. SHAvite-3 is both fast and resource-efficient, making it suitable for a wide range of environments, ranging from 8-bit platforms to 64-bit platforms (and beyond)."

Not only did the entire banking system collapse in 2008, but the monetary history of Iceland is one of inflation, devaluation and currency controls.  Auroracoin is an opportunity for Icelanders to free themselves from currency controls and government debasement of the currency.uroracoin is based on the Litecoin protocol. However, it is started by the “Airdrop” of premined auroracoins to the Icelandic nation, designed to reach almost every Icelander. This one-time event will create the conditions for Icelanders to start using the currency, by providing them with a start and making them aware of the currency and its possibilities. After the Airdrop, the only way to acquire auroracoins will be through mining and transacting."
