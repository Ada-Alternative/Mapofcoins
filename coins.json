        "Info": "Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called crypto-currency, which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list. Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than relying on central authorities. In 2009, the first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in a cryptography mailing list by a member under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto.Towards the end of 2010 Satoshi left the project, saying he had moved on to other things. However since 2010, the Bitcoin community has grown a lot. And there is no wonder: Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system."

One of the aims of Litecoin was to provide a mining algorithm that could run at the same time, on the same hardware used to mine bitcoins. With the rise of specialized ASICs for Bitcoin, Litecoin continues to satisfy these goals. It is unlikely for ASIC mining to be developed for Litecoin until the currency is widely used."

However this coin was not seen in positive eyes by some members of the forum (namely Luke-Jr(references needed) and Greedi), so Greedi performed a 51% attack on the chain and stopped people mining coins and rejected blocks from other users. This attack meant that people lost interest and faith in BBQcoin. Then on February 08, 2013, 07:58:05 PM it was announced by user markm that BBQcoin was still ticking along and has been since it started and that now that the attackers have left the alt-currency forum BBQ coin seemed to gain a little support and miners hopped back on inthe hope of mining at not such ridiculous difficulties. The original developer Cubox seems to have almost abandoned the project and the original source code is not available, though look in the downloads section as figroll, a member of the BBQcoin development team, has forked the original BBQ repository and made it available.

Devcoins provide an income for anyone who wants to work, even if they live in an area with more job seekers than jobs. 90% of Devcoin generation goes to open source projects with bounties for accomplishments and regular payments for active developers. By buying Devcoins, you help fund developers and give the world more open source software, books, music, art, and movies. Bounties are funded based on market capitalization. When the market capitalization of Devcoin reaches a certain point, a massive bounty will be offered for the development of an open source one seater spacecraft which can exit and enter the Earth's atmosphere."

Unlike Bitcoin, Freicoin has a demurrage fee (4.89%) that ensures its circulation and bearers of the currency pay this fee automatically. This demurrage fee was proposed by Silvio Gesell to eliminate the privileged position held by money compared with capital goods, which is the underlying cause of the boom/bust business cycle and the entrenchment of the financial elite, and has been tested several times with positive results. Freicoin's parameters are carefully chosen to eliminate the basic interest component of investments, called the liquidity premium by economists. Usurious non-zero basic interest distorts the free market, incentivises poisonous greed, excess, and short-term thinking, and perpetuates a vicious cycle of boom/bust recessions."

It also requires far less energy than generating hardware-intensive proof-of-work hashes. Proof-of-stake also does away with the ~$1 billion tax on the Bitcoin network through proof-of-work blocks."
